# Laravel Flow

A lightweight job orchestrator for Laravel. Wraps queued jobs into composable,
observable pipelines with revert (saga) and fan-out (subtask) support.

A `Flow` is a PHP class with a `run()` method that returns a `Generator`. Each
`yield` inside `run()` hands a `Task` (or a `Signal`) to the orchestrator, which
dispatches it as a queued Laravel job, saves state, and goes to sleep. When the
job finishes, the orchestrator wakes up and sends the result back into the
generator.

This is the **continuation pattern** — a flow is not a long-running process. It
is a short-lived job that wakes up, makes one decision, dispatches one task,
saves state, and sleeps again. Because the `Generator` cannot be serialized, the
orchestrator **rebuilds it from scratch on every wake-up** and fast-forwards it
to the current position by replaying the outputs of completed steps.

> **`run()` must be side-effect free.** It is re-executed up to the current step
> on every wake-up. No DB writes, no API calls, no randomness — everything with a
> side effect belongs in `Task::handle()`.

## Requirements

- PHP 8.3+
- Laravel 13

## Installation

Install via Composer:

```bash
composer require sergiumhi/laravel-flow
```

The service provider is auto-discovered. Run the migrations to create the two
tables the engine needs (`flows` and `flow_tasks`):

```bash
php artisan migrate
```

The migrations ship with the package and are loaded automatically — there is
nothing to publish. If you want to customise the schema, you can copy them into
your app and disable package auto-loading, but most apps never need to.

Optionally publish the config file:

```bash
php artisan vendor:publish --tag=flow-config
```

It works with any queue driver (`sync`, `database`, `redis`, `sqs`). On the
`sync` driver a flow runs to completion (or to its first pause/signal) inside the
`start()` call, which makes it trivial to try and to test.

## Quick start

```php
use App\Flows\GreetingFlow;
use Sergiumhi\LaravelFlow\Flow;

// Start a flow with an input payload.
$flow = GreetingFlow::start(['name' => 'Ada']);

$flow->publicId();   // "flow_01J..."
$flow->status();     // FlowStatus enum

// Look one up later by its public id.
$flow = Flow::find('flow_01J...');
```

## Defining a flow

Extend `Sergiumhi\LaravelFlow\Flow` and implement `run()` as a generator. Your
flow classes live wherever you like; the convention is `app/Flows`
(`App\Flows`), which is what `flow:run` resolves short names against.

```php
namespace App\Flows;

use App\Tasks\BuildGreetingTask;
use App\Tasks\RecordGreetingTask;
use App\Tasks\ShoutGreetingTask;
use Generator;
use Sergiumhi\LaravelFlow\Flow;

class GreetingFlow extends Flow
{
    public function run(array $payload): Generator
    {
        // run() receives the array passed to start(). Pass it (or any subset)
        // explicitly to each task via init() — tasks do not receive the flow
        // payload implicitly. $payload is also yours to branch on directly.
        $built = yield BuildGreetingTask::init($payload);

        // Later tasks are fed from the previous result (output chaining).
        $shouted = yield ShoutGreetingTask::init(['text' => $built['greeting']]);

        yield RecordGreetingTask::init(['message' => $shouted['shout']]);
    }
}
```

Start it:

```php
GreetingFlow::start(['name' => 'Ada']);
```

## Defining a task

A `Task` is a thin wrapper around a unit of work. The work lives in `handle()`.
There is **no separate Laravel Job class to write** — the framework generates and
dispatches the underlying queued job for you.

```php
namespace App\Tasks;

use Sergiumhi\LaravelFlow\Task;

class ProcessPaymentTask extends Task
{
    public function handle(): array
    {
        // ... do the work, reading inputs from $this->payload ...
        return ['charge_id' => 'ch_1', 'requiresManualReview' => false];
    }
}
```

### Task API

```php
use Sergiumhi\LaravelFlow\OnFailure;

// No payload
yield ProcessPaymentTask::init();

// With a payload — handle() reads it via $this->payload
yield ProcessPaymentTask::init(['amount' => 100]);

// Register a compensating task for revert
yield ProcessPaymentTask::init($payload)->revert(RefundPaymentTask::class);

// Declare failure behaviour (default is OnFailure::PAUSE)
yield SyncAnalyticsTask::init($payload)->onFailure(OnFailure::SKIP);
```

The payload is passed once, to `init()`, and read inside `handle()` via
`$this->payload`. There is no separate `->with()`, and `handle()` takes no
argument.

### Retries

Override `tries()` to retry a task before it is considered finally failed. The
framework manages retries itself (so behaviour is identical under `sync` and
async queues); the `attempts` column tracks how many times it ran.

```php
class ChargeCardTask extends Task
{
    public function tries(): int
    {
        return 3;
    }

    public function handle(): array { /* ... */ }
}
```

## Passing data: payload & output chaining

A task reads its inputs from `$this->payload` — exactly the array passed to its
`init(...)` at the yield site. Nothing is merged in implicitly. You feed that
payload from two sources:

1. **Flow payload** — `run(array $payload)` receives the array passed to
   `Flow::start()`. Thread it (or any subset) into the tasks that need it. The
   same array is yours to branch on directly (e.g. `if ($payload['requires_review'] ?? false)`).
2. **Output chaining** — the value a task returns becomes the result of its
   `yield`, so you can feed it into the next task explicitly:

   ```php
   $a = yield BuildGreetingTask::init($payload);   // returns ['greeting' => '...']
   yield ShoutGreetingTask::init(['text' => $a['greeting']]);
   ```

Tasks never communicate through a shared payload — only through the generator.
This keeps `run()` the single place that wires steps together, and makes every
task's inputs visible at its call site.

## Signals

A `Signal` is a named pause point. The flow stops at the yield and waits —
indefinitely, with no timeout and no job dispatched — until an external caller
sends the signal. The flow status becomes `waiting`.

```php
use Sergiumhi\LaravelFlow\Signal;

// Inside run() — pause until 'manual_approval' arrives.
$approval = yield Signal::waitFor('manual_approval');
// $approval is the payload that was sent, e.g. ['approved_by' => 7]
```

Send the signal from outside:

```php
Flow::find($publicId)->signal('manual_approval', ['approved_by' => $user->id]);
```

Rules:

- **One signal per yield.**
- **No timeout** — the flow waits indefinitely.
- **Wrong name is ignored** — sending a name the flow is not waiting for is a no-op.
- **Not-waiting is ignored** — a signal to a flow that is not currently waiting is a no-op.

## Subtasks (fan-out)

A task can spawn child tasks by returning a `SubTaskCollection` from `handle()`.
The parent stays `running` until all children finish; the parent's output is then
the **aggregated list of subtask outputs**, which flows into the next step.

Subtasks use the same `Task` base class — the only difference is structural (they
have a `parent_id`). **Subtasks cannot spawn further subtasks** (max depth is two).

### Parallel (all at once)

```php
use Sergiumhi\LaravelFlow\SubTaskCollection;
use Sergiumhi\LaravelFlow\Task;

class ProcessCsvTask extends Task
{
    public function handle(): SubTaskCollection
    {
        $chunks = array_chunk($this->payload['rows'], $this->payload['chunk_size']);

        return SubTaskCollection::parallel(
            array_map(fn ($chunk) => ProcessChunkTask::init(['chunk' => $chunk]), $chunks),
        );
    }
}
```

### Sequential (one at a time, in order)

```php
return SubTaskCollection::sequential([
    BuildSectionTask::init(['section' => 'intro']),
    BuildSectionTask::init(['section' => 'body']),
]);
```

The aggregated output is available on the parent's yield:

```php
$chunks = yield ProcessCsvTask::init($payload);   // [['rows_processed' => 3], ...]
yield GenerateReportTask::init(['chunks' => $chunks]);
```

## Failure handling

Each task declares what happens when it fails after exhausting its retries, via
`->onFailure()` (default `OnFailure::PAUSE`).

| Value | Behaviour |
|---|---|
| `OnFailure::PAUSE` | Flow status → `paused`. Waits for `retryCurrentTask()`, `skipCurrentTask()`, or `cancel()`. |
| `OnFailure::SKIP` | Task marked `skipped`; the flow advances automatically. |
| `OnFailure::REVERT` | Flow immediately reverts all completed tasks in reverse. |

```php
yield ProcessPaymentTask::init($payload)->onFailure(OnFailure::PAUSE);  // default
yield SyncAnalyticsTask::init($payload)->onFailure(OnFailure::SKIP);    // non-critical
yield ChargeCardTask::init($payload)->onFailure(OnFailure::REVERT);     // roll everything back
```

A failed **subtask** always pauses the flow (its parent is marked `failed`);
subtask failures are coarse-grained on purpose — `onFailure` is **not** consulted
for subtasks. The first child to exhaust its own `tries()` flips the parent to
`failed` and parks the flow at `paused`, with `current_task_id` pointing at the
**parent** (not the failed child). Siblings already finished keep their
`completed` status.

### Recovering a failed fan-out

From a paused fan-out you have two recovery paths:

| Call | Effect |
|---|---|
| `retryCurrentTask()` | Re-runs the **whole parent** from scratch: its `handle()` executes again and regenerates the entire `SubTaskCollection`, so **every** chunk re-runs (the old children are discarded first). |
| `retryFailedSubtasks()` | Re-dispatches **only the `failed` children**, leaving the `completed` ones untouched. The flow resumes only once **every** child has finished. |

`retryFailedSubtasks()` is what you want for large fan-outs (e.g. importing a
5M-row CSV as dozens of 10k-row chunks): a mid-batch failure re-runs just the
broken chunks rather than reprocessing the ones that already succeeded.

## Revert (saga pattern)

When `cancelAndRevert()` is called (or `OnFailure::REVERT` fires), the orchestrator
walks **backwards** through all completed top-level tasks and runs each task's revert
task, if one is defined.

```
Completed:  ProcessPayment ✓    ChargeShipping ✓    (then revert is triggered)

Revert runs in reverse:
  1. CancelShippingTask   (reverts ChargeShipping)
  2. RefundPaymentTask    (reverts ProcessPayment)
```

Each revert is a normal queued task (with its own retries). The flow status is
`reverting` during the saga. The terminal status depends on what triggered it: a
user-initiated `cancelAndRevert()` ends `reverted` (and the remaining, not-yet-run
tasks are marked `cancelled`), while a failure-driven `OnFailure::REVERT` ends
`failed`.

> Plain `cancel()` is different: it halts **without** reverting — the remaining tasks
> are marked `cancelled`, the flow ends `cancelled`, and completed work is left in
> place. Use it to stop a flow and keep its side effects.

The revert task receives the original task's output as its payload:

- An **associative** output (e.g. `['charge_id' => ...]`) is merged over the flow
  payload, so its fields are directly accessible.
- The raw output is always available under the `output` key — useful for a
  subtask parent, whose aggregated output is a list.

```php
class RefundPaymentTask extends Task
{
    public function handle(): array
    {
        return ['refunded' => $this->payload['charge_id']];   // directly accessible
    }
}
```

## Manual control of a running flow

```php
$flow = Flow::find($publicId);

// Re-dispatch the failed task from scratch.
$flow->retryCurrentTask();

// Skip the failed task and advance.
$flow->skipCurrentTask();

// Re-run only the failed children of a failed subtask parent (keep the rest).
$flow->retryFailedSubtasks();

// Reset a task and everything after it, then re-run from there.
$flow->retryFromTask($taskPublicId);

// Halt without reverting: remaining tasks → cancelled, flow → cancelled.
$flow->cancel();

// Halt and run revert tasks in reverse: flow → reverted.
$flow->cancelAndRevert();

// Resume a flow that is waiting on a signal.
$flow->signal('manual_approval', ['approved_by' => 7]);
```

## Job timing

Every task and subtask records three timestamps for its underlying queued job:

| Column | Set when | Meaning |
|---|---|---|
| `job_dispatched_at` | Orchestrator dispatches the job | In the queue, not yet picked up |
| `job_started_at` | Worker calls `handle()` | Execution begins |
| `job_finished_at` | `handle()` returns or throws | Execution ended |

From these you can derive queue wait (`started - dispatched`), execution time
(`finished - started`), and total time. For a task with subtasks, the parent's
`job_finished_at` is set when the **last subtask** completes.

## Events (live updates)

Every time a flow or a task changes status, the engine dispatches a plain
domain event so you can drive live UIs (polling, SSE, websockets), send
notifications, or write metrics:

| Event | Dispatched when | Payload |
|---|---|---|
| `FlowStateChanged` | A flow's `status` changes | `$flow` (model), `$from`, `$to` (`FlowStatus`) |
| `FlowTaskStateChanged` | A task's `status` changes | `$task` (model), `$from`, `$to` (`FlowTaskStatus`) |

Both carry `from`/`to` so a listener can react to a specific transition without
re-querying:

```php
use Sergiumhi\LaravelFlow\Events\FlowStateChanged;
use Sergiumhi\LaravelFlow\FlowStatus;

Event::listen(function (FlowStateChanged $event) {
    if ($event->to === FlowStatus::Failed) {
        // notify, log, alert…
        report(new FlowFailed($event->flow->public_id));
    }
});
```

These events are **deliberately not broadcastable** — they do not implement
`ShouldBroadcast`. The engine only announces "this flow/task moved from X to Y";
*how* that reaches a browser is your app's choice, so the package never forces a
websocket stack on consumers who just want to log or notify. The delivery
mechanism does not change anything in the package — the same single event feeds
all three:

- **Polling** — ignore the events entirely; the `flows` / `flow_tasks` tables
  are the source of truth, so just query them on an interval.
- **Websockets (Reverb / Echo)** — re-broadcast in a thin app-side listener:

  ```php
  // app/Events/FlowUpdated.php — your app's broadcastable wrapper
  class FlowUpdated implements ShouldBroadcast
  {
      public function __construct(public string $flowId, public string $status) {}

      public function broadcastOn(): Channel
      {
          return new PrivateChannel("flows.{$this->flowId}");
      }
  }

  // A listener on the package event rebroadcasts it
  Event::listen(function (FlowStateChanged $event) {
      broadcast(new FlowUpdated($event->flow->public_id, $event->to->value));
  });
  ```

- **SSE** — bridge to Redis and block on a subscribe in your SSE endpoint:

  ```php
  Event::listen(function (FlowStateChanged $event) {
      Redis::publish("flows.{$event->flow->public_id}", $event->to->value);
  });
  ```

Disable dispatching entirely via config (see
[Configuration](#configuration)) — set `flow.events.enabled` to `false`.

## Status reference

### Flow statuses (`flows.status`)

| Status | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `pending` | Created, not yet started |
| `running` | Actively dispatching tasks |
| `waiting` | Parked at a signal, waiting for an external signal |
| `paused` | A task failed, waiting for manual action |
| `reverting` | Running revert tasks in reverse |
| `completed` | All tasks finished successfully |
| `failed` | Ended in failure (after `OnFailure::REVERT` compensation or skip) |
| `cancelled` | Halted via `cancel()` — remaining tasks cancelled, no revert |
| `reverted` | Halted via `cancelAndRevert()` — completed tasks compensated |

### Task statuses (`flow_tasks.status`)

| Status | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `pending` | Known but not yet dispatched |
| `running` | Dispatched (or waiting for subtasks) |
| `completed` | Finished successfully |
| `failed` | Failed after all retries |
| `skipped` | Skipped via `OnFailure::SKIP` or `skipCurrentTask()` |
| `waiting` | Signal yield, waiting for an external signal |
| `reverting` | Revert task is running |
| `reverted` | Revert finished |
| `abandoned` | Seeded as a DAG preview but never reached (the branch was not taken) |
| `cancelled` | Not-yet-run when a `cancel()` / `cancelAndRevert()` halted the flow |

## Artisan commands

```bash
# Start a flow by name (short name, "studly" name, or FQCN) with a JSON payload.
php artisan flow:run order --payload='{"order_id":1,"requires_review":true}'

# Inspect a flow's DAG, statuses, and timing.
php artisan flow:status flow_01J...

# Resume a flow that is waiting on a signal.
php artisan flow:signal flow_01J... manual_approval --payload='{"approved_by":7}'

# Delete finished flow runs older than the retention period.
php artisan flow:prune --days=30
```

`flow:run` resolves short names against your flows namespace
(`App\Flows` by default — see [Configuration](#configuration)). On the `database`
queue driver, run a worker (`php artisan queue:work`) so dispatched jobs are
processed. On `sync` everything runs inline.

## Configuration

Publish the config with `php artisan vendor:publish --tag=flow-config` to get
`config/flow.php`:

```php
return [
    // Swap these for your own subclasses to extend the engine's models.
    'flow_model' => \Sergiumhi\LaravelFlow\Models\FlowModel::class,
    'flow_tasks_model' => \Sergiumhi\LaravelFlow\Models\FlowTask::class,

    // The namespace segment under app/ that holds your flow classes (App\Flows).
    // Used by flow:run to resolve a flow from a short name.
    'flows_folder' => 'Flows',

    // Dispatch FlowStateChanged / FlowTaskStateChanged on every status
    // transition (see "Events"). Set to false to skip dispatching entirely.
    'events' => [
        'enabled' => true,
    ],

    'prune' => [
        'command' => \Sergiumhi\LaravelFlow\Console\Commands\FlowPruneCommand::class,
        'retention_days' => 30,
        // Set to true to register the daily prune on the scheduler automatically.
        // Off by default so the package never deletes data without opt-in.
        'schedule' => false,
    ],
];
```

### Extending the models

Both Eloquent models are resolved through config, so you can extend them:

```php
use Sergiumhi\LaravelFlow\Models\FlowModel;

class Flow extends FlowModel
{
    // your relationships, scopes, casts...
}
```

```php
// config/flow.php
'flow_model' => \App\Models\Flow::class,
```

### Pruning on a schedule

Set `flow.prune.schedule` to `true` to have the package register the daily prune
on Laravel's scheduler. It is **off by default** — a package should never delete
your data without an explicit opt-in. You can also call `flow:prune` from your
own schedule definition instead.

## How it works (orchestrator lifecycle)

```
1. OrderFlow::start(['order_id' => 1])
   → creates a flows row (status: pending)
   → statically analyses run() to seed every top-level yield (both sides of
     conditionals) as preview rows, plus a preview child for any fan-out a
     task's handle() declares — for full DAG visibility up front
   → dispatches FlowOrchestratorJob

2. FlowOrchestratorJob (advance)
   → rebuilds the generator, replays completed steps, reconciles the DAG
   → next yield is a Task   → mark running, dispatch FlowTaskJob
   → next yield is a Signal → mark waiting, record signal_waited_at, stop
   → generator exhausted    → mark the flow completed

3. FlowTaskJob (run a task)
   → calls handle()
   → returns array             → task completed, dispatch FlowOrchestratorJob
   → returns SubTaskCollection → persist children, dispatch them
   → throws                    → retry if attempts remain, else route by OnFailure

4. Subtask finishes
   → all siblings done → aggregate output, complete parent, advance the flow
   → sequential        → dispatch the next sibling
```

At `start()`, the framework statically analyses `run()` (via `nikic/php-parser`)
— parsing every `yield SomeTask::init(...)` and `yield Signal::waitFor(...)` in
source order, including **both sides of every conditional branch**. Each becomes
a *seed row* that the orchestrator *promotes* to a real execution row as the
generator actually reaches it. Branches never taken are marked `abandoned`.

It also looks one level deeper: for each seeded task it inspects that task's
`handle()` for a `SubTaskCollection::parallel(...)` / `::sequential(...)` and
seeds **preview child rows** under the parent — so a fan-out shows up in the DAG
before it runs. A literal list (e.g. `sequential([A::init(), A::init()])`) seeds
one child per element; a dynamically built collection (e.g. `array_map` over
runtime data, where the count is unknowable) seeds one child per distinct subtask
class. When the parent actually fans out at runtime, the previews are replaced by
the real children; if its branch is never taken, they are marked `abandoned`.
This gives the full shape of the flow up front, before anything runs.

## Testing

The package is tested against Orchestra Testbench on an in-memory SQLite
database with the `sync` queue:

```bash
composer test
```
